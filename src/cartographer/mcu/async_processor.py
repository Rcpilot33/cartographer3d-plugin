Async processor for handling MCU data on the main reactor thread.

This module provides thread-safe processing of MCU samples by queuing them
from the MCU response thread and processing them on the main reactor thread
where it's safe to access stepper positions and other shared state.

    Process items asynchronously on the main reactor thread.

    Items received from background threads are queued and processed on
